# Catch-it

Catch is a game where you catch falling objects. Each caught object gives the player a point
and each missed object makes the player lose health. The game is written in java and
built with maven.

Archive: Project has been archived since June 5th 2024, but was unarchived for a sort while on January 7th 2025 for a one-time update.

## Motivation

The catch game has been reproduced hundreds of times before, but very few try to modernize it.
This project is meant to be a game of catch that utilizes state-of-the-art tools and ideas while keeping the gameplay largely the same.
